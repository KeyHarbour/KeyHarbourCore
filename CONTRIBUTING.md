# Contributing Guide

Thank you for your interest in KeyHarbourCore! It is contributors like you who make this project grow and improve.

Please take a moment to review this guide before getting started with your contribution.

## How Can I Contribute?

### 1. Reporting Bugs & Proposing Features
Before opening a new issue, please search the existing [Issues](https://github.com/KeyHarbour/KeyHarbourCore/issues) to make sure your topic hasn't been discussed already.

When opening a new issue, please include:
* A clear, descriptive title.
* Steps to reproduce the bug (if applicable).
* What you expected to happen versus what actually happened.

### 2. Contributing Code (Pull Requests)
To maintain project quality and security, we enforce branch protection rules on the `main` branch. Please follow these steps to contribute code:

1. **Fork** the repository to your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone** your fork locally:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:KeyHarbour/KeyHarbourCore.git
   ```
3. **Create a new branch** for your changes (avoid working directly on `main`):
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-amazing-feature
   ```
4. **Make your changes** while adhering to the existing code style and formatting.
5. **Run tests** locally (if the project has them) to ensure everything works properly.
6. **Commit** your changes with clear, descriptive commit messages.
7. **Push** your branch to your remote fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-amazing-feature
   ```
8. Open a **Pull Request (PR)** from your fork's branch to our project's `main` branch.

## Pull Request Requirements

For a PR to be merged, it must meet the following criteria:
* **Code Review:** At least one project maintainer must visually inspect and approve your changes.
* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Automated tests and checks (if configured) must pass successfully.
* **No Direct/Force Pushes:** Force pushes onto the protected main branch are strictly blocked.
